**1.Iris Classification - Machine Learning Project**

**Overview**
This project builds a classification model to predict Iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on sepal and petal measurements. It serves as an introductory machine learning problem and explores data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation techniques.

**Technologies Used**
- Programming: Python (Jupyter Notebook, VS Code)
- Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Machine Learning Models: KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix
  
**Project Steps**
- Data Exploration: Understanding dataset features and distributions
- Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, data splitting
- Model Training: Comparing different classification algorithms
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model performance with Grid Search
- Evaluation: Assessing accuracy and visualizing results
- Insights: Feature importance analysis and decision boundary visualization
